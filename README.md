A 3D editor built for and with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).
Very early in dev, expect bugs and changes! A BSN-friendly branch exists on the bsn-editor branch (the flow is to read/write to the BSN AST and then sync to the ECS for rendering the UI and viewport).

We have also recently refactored our UX/UI to be _very_ similar to the official Bevy Editor Figma design, to keep things consistent. [Link here](https://www.figma.com/design/fkYfFPSBgnGkhbQd3HOMsL/Bevy-Editor?node-id=90-2)

## Features

- **Brush-based geometry** draw, edit, and CSG-combine convex brushes with vertex/edge/face/clip editing modes
- **Material system** VERY wip - texture browser, material definitions with ORM auto-detection, per-face application
- **Terrain** heightmap sculpting and texture painting, very WIP :)
- **Scene serialization** save/load scenes in the `.jsn` format with full asset references. Ideally to be replaced with BSN once ready. 
- **Transform tools** translate, rotate, scale with grid snapping and axis constraints
- **Undo/redo** full command history - some bugs atm with this
- **Extensible** register custom components, add inspector panels, integrate with your game
