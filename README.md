A 3D editor built for and with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).
Very early in dev, expect bugs and changes!

## Features

- **Brush-based geometry** draw, edit, and CSG-combine convex brushes with vertex/edge/face/clip editing modes
- **Material system** VERY wip - texture browser, material definitions with ORM auto-detection, per-face application
- **Terrain** heightmap sculpting and texture painting, very WIP :)
- **Scene serialization** save/load scenes in the `.jsn` format with full asset references. Ideally to be replaced with BSN once ready. 
- **Transform tools** translate, rotate, scale with grid snapping and axis constraints
- **Undo/redo** full command history - some bugs atm with this
- **Extensible** register custom components, add inspector panels, integrate with your game

## Usage

Add `jackdaw` to your project:

```sh
cargo add jackdaw
```

Then add the `EditorPlugin` to your app:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use jackdaw::EditorPlugin;

fn main() -> AppExit {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, EditorPlugin))
        ...
        .run()
}
```

See the [examples](examples/) for more advanced usage.
